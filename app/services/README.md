#### `ChatManager` Class
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of `ChatManager`.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the chat state.
- **Methods**:
  - `getCurrentMessages`: Returns current messages.
  - `getInstance`: Retrieves the singleton instance of `ChatManager`.
  - `startAssistant`: Initiates the assistant with necessary details.
  - `sendMessage`: Handles sending and processing of user messages.
  - `getChatState`: Provides access to the chat's current state.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporates error handling in various methods.

### Usage
- `api.ts` is used for direct interactions with the backend APIs, handling various functionalities like file uploads, assistant management, and message handling.
- `ChatManager.ts` manages the chat's internal state and operations, providing an interface to interact with the chat functionalities.

## Conclusion
Both `api.ts` and `ChatManager.ts` are integral to the chat application's functioning, offering a structured approach to managing API interactions and chat state. Understanding and utilizing these modules effectively is crucial for developers working on the chat application.
