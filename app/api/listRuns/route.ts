/**
 * API Route - List Runs in a Thread
 *
 * This API route is responsible for retrieving runs from a specific chat thread using the OpenAI API.
 * It processes POST requests that include a 'threadId' in the form data. The route fetches the runs
 * associated with the provided thread ID and returns them in a structured JSON format. It's designed to
 * facilitate the tracking and review of runs created and managed via OpenAI's GPT models.
 *
 * Path: /api/listRuns
